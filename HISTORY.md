Welcome to Sackerlscript! 🍻
Hello fellow code enthusiasts! 👾

You’ve just stumbled upon Sackerlscript, a quirky and fun project where we combine the power of programming with the rich, expressive, and (some would say) uniquely charming Austrian Umgangssprache.
If you've ever wondered what it would be like to code in a language that speaks the heart and soul of Austrian dialect, then look no further! 🍺

Sackerlscript is designed to make programming fun while adding a touch of local flavor. 
Forget the boring syntax of conventional languages—Sackerlscript brings humor, personality, and that unmistakable Austrian vibe to your code.
It's not about efficiency; it's about having a good time while coding in a style that feels like you’re chatting with a local.

Key Features
Austrian Umgangssprache to be specific vienna Umgangssprache :D : Your code will speak like the streetwise, cheeky lingo of the Austrians. That’s right, you can now definieren variables in a way that feels more like a pub conversation than a dry algorithm!

Fun Syntax: Why settle for standard? Why not sprinkle a bit of fun and culture into your coding experience? 🎉

Sackerlscript is a community-driven project and everyone is welcome to participate! Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer, you’re encouraged to contribute, share your ideas, and help make the language even more fun and unique.

I am still at the beginnning of my coding carrer therefore my abilitys and knowlegde about programming are limited :) , so 
if you feel like adding your own touches to the language, or if you have ideas to make the code even more entertaining, feel free to fork the repo, create a branch, and submit a pull request. 
The more humor, the better! There’s always room for new slang, new features, and new ways to make coding even more enjoyable.

My dream is that this language grows and eventually gets used by someone – of course, just for fun! 🤙
So, what are you waiting for? Let’s add a little bit of Sackerl into our daily coding lives and have some fun with it!

Cheers,
Luca,
Creator of Sackerlscript
